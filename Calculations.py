# To start of we will ask the user to state the first number of the calculation
# We allow the user to give input
# The input is converted to an integer so we can calculate with it later on
# We label the input as "x"
x = int(input("Please give the first number of your calculation stated as an integer"))
# Secondly we will ask the user to state the second number of the calculation
# We allow the user to give input
# The input is converted to an integer so we can calculate with it later on
# We label the input as "y"
y = int(input("Please give the second number of your calculation stated as an integer"))
# We calculate the sum of "x" and "y" and label the outcome as "z"
z = x + y
# Lastly we provide the user with the outcome of the calculation
print("The outcome of your calculation is", z)
